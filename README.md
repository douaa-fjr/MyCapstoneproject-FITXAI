# FitXAI - AI Fitness Web App

##  About the Project
FitXAI is a smart fitness web application developed as my graduation capstone project. It integrates computer vision and web technologies to help users track their workouts at home. The app uses a webcam and pose estimation to count exercise repetitions in real-time, making fitness more interactive and data-driven.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask / Django)
- **AI Models:** Pose estimation (e.g., Mediapipe / OpenPose), rep-counting logic
- **Tools:** OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch

##  Features
- Real-time camera access for exercise detection
- Automatic rep counting of 4 exercices (e.g., squats, push-ups...)
- Visual feedback on posture/form
- Lightweight & works in-browser

##  Project Outcomes
- Rep accuracy: 92%+ on tested exercises
- Smooth browser integration on Chrome & Firefox
- Responsive UI with fast backend performance

##  My Role
-  Collection of data and Organization
- Designed and implemented full-stack architecture
- Integrated camera + pose model into web app
- Handled real-time inference and rep tracking logic
  
## Time spent: 3 months
